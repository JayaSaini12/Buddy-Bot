Buddy Chatbot


Buddy Chatbot is an interactive conversational bot built using Python and Streamlit. It leverages natural language processing techniques and the Wikipedia API to provide information and engage in conversations with users.

Features:





Wikipedia Search: Users can enter a topic of interest, and the chatbot retrieves relevant content from Wikipedia.


Greeting: The chatbot greets users with random responses to create a friendly interaction.


Sentence Similarity: The chatbot uses cosine similarity to find the most relevant sentence to the user's input and provides a response based on that sentence.


Conversation Handling: Users can ask multiple questions or engage in conversations with the chatbot in a continuous manner.


Exit Functionality: The chatbot recognizes exit commands such as "bye," "quit," or "see you later" to gracefully end the conversation.
